# Zoo architecture

Zoo is a game first, but it must not become a second implementation of generic engine infrastructure that already has an authority elsewhere in this workspace.

The architectural goal is the smallest playable vertical slice built on the intended long-term foundations, not the smallest self-contained amount of code.

## Authority map

| Concern | Authority | Zoo responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Park rules, money, placement validity, guest/animal decisions, staff work, saves | `zoo-core` | Own the deterministic game semantics and stable game IDs. |
| Zoo-specific scene framing, orbit/zoom policy, mapping game-space state toward shared scene contracts | `zoo-scene` | Adapt Zoo state without becoming a generic renderer or camera-math authority. |
| Camera matrices, transforms, renderer-independent mesh/asset semantics, animation primitives, LOD, and the reusable concrete Three.js browser renderer | `moritzbrantner/3d-lab` | Supply Zoo scene data and interaction policy; consume the shared renderer instead of constructing a parallel renderer. |
| Generated/processed asset provenance, canonical asset catalog, reproducible 3D processing | `moritzbrantner/asset-tooling` | Declare Zoo asset intent and consume verified outputs. |
| Collision response, rigid-body motion, CCD, physical spatial queries | `moritzbrantner/physics-engine` | Integrate only where physical truth is part of gameplay; do not approximate engine behavior in React. |
| ECS storage experiments and benchmark evidence | `moritzbrantner/ecs-lab` | No direct runtime dependency. Reusable ECS functionality must first become an intentional shared foundation rather than being copied out of the lab. |
| Geographic/MapLibre map presentation and geo-data utilities | `moritzbrantner/maps` | No forced dependency for the current tile park. Reuse only a genuinely applicable data/spatial contract; Zoo owns its park-grid semantics. |
| React UI, touch/mouse/keyboard interaction, HUD/windows, and thin consumer glue | `apps/web` | Present authoritative state and translate user intent into commands. It must not own game balance, placement validity, generic rendering, camera projection math, or physics semantics. |

## Current correction

The browser presentation grew from an MVP into a local pseudo-3D engine: CSS perspective/3D transforms, local yaw/pitch projection policy, object billboard compensation, and a large `App.tsx` all accumulated in the product repository. That proved the game loop but created the wrong durable authority boundary.

The migration therefore proceeds upstream-first:

1. The missing orthographic/isometric-capable camera primitive was added to `3d-lab` rather than extending Zoo's CSS camera math.
2. `zoo-scene` is the thin Zoo-owned adapter over one exact pinned `3d-lab` revision. It owns park framing, free orbit, pitch bounds, zoom limits, pan clamping, and the mapping from a picked ground point to the park grid, while returning shared `three-d-camera` perspective matrices and unprojecting through shared `three-d-projective` inversion.
3. `3d-lab` now also owns the reusable concrete Three.js renderer. Zoo consumes it at the same exact accepted revision; React does not instantiate its own generic renderer.
4. The park view is one shared-renderer canvas. Terrain, fences, buildings, concessions, habitat furnishings, animals, guests, staff, litter, maintenance markers, and interaction overlays (hover, placement ghosts, selection) are all shared scene nodes composed by `apps/web/src/park-scene.ts`. The earlier transitional DOM tile/object layer, its MutationObserver reprojection, and the CSS pseudo-3D stylesheets have been removed. Static nodes (terrain, fences, buildings, and the surrounding scenery) are submitted as shared-renderer instance batches, grouped per unit primitive and 16-tile ground cell by `apps/web/src/scene-batching.ts`, so the park costs roughly a hundred draw calls instead of one per part; animated actors remain individual nodes.
5. Picking is renderer-side: ground/tile picks come from `zoo-scene` (shared inverse view-projection intersected with the park ground plane), and actor/building picks compare pointer position against anchors projected with the shared `createWorldProjector` helper. Final command validity remains a `zoo-core` decision.
6. Durable 3D assets move through `asset-tooling`; renderer-independent mesh/material/LOD semantics remain in `3d-lab`.
7. Path construction, habitat ownership, guest choices, welfare, economy, staff tasks, and other game-specific rules remain in `zoo-core`.
8. `physics-engine` is added only for interactions whose gameplay semantics require physical collision/motion truth. Tile occupancy and ordinary park pathfinding do not become physics problems merely because the game is rendered in 3D.

## Dependency policy

Cross-repository dependencies must be pinned to exact accepted revisions. If a required shared contract is unavailable or incompatible, validation should fail closed rather than silently falling back to a second local implementation.

Both `zoo-scene` and the browser renderer consumer pin the accepted `3d-lab` revision. A pin moves only to another reviewed/accepted revision; it must not become a branch-tip dependency.

A local substitute is acceptable only when all of the following hold:

- the behavior is genuinely Zoo-specific, or the shared authority explicitly does not own it;
- the substitute does not establish a competing generic contract;
- the boundary and later migration cost are documented;
- deterministic/game-authoritative behavior remains in Rust.

## Rendering boundary

`zoo-core` emits stable game state and game-space coordinates. `zoo-scene` maps the presentation-facing parts into shared camera/scene semantics. `@moritzbrantner/three-d-renderer` from `3d-lab` owns concrete Three.js scene/GPU adaptation, including the WebGPU-camera to WebGL-depth boundary and reusable world-to-screen projection.

Camera orbit, zoom gestures, framing targets, and persistence are Zoo interaction policy. Projection/view math and concrete rendering are shared 3D infrastructure. Selection and placement intent may originate in the presentation layer, but final validity remains a `zoo-core` decision.

The park has no DOM interaction layer. `apps/web/src/ParkView.tsx` interprets mouse, wheel, keyboard, and touch gestures (one-finger pan, pinch zoom, twist rotate, two-finger vertical tilt) into `zoo-scene` camera calls and tile/actor picks, and translates tool gestures into the same `zoo-core` commands on desktop and phone.

Mobile and desktop inputs must converge on the same commands. Touch-specific gesture handling is presentation state and must not create a second rules path.

## Asset boundary

Zoo asset specifications and accepted generated outputs carry provenance through `asset-tooling`. Mesh/material/LOD processing remains owned by the corresponding `3d-lab` contracts and processors. Zoo may choose art direction and species/building requirements; it should not implement another generic asset pipeline.

## Physics boundary

The current management simulation does not need rigid-body physics for ordinary grid movement, placement, or guest pathfinding. When gameplay introduces physically meaningful interactions, Zoo should adapt stable Zoo entity IDs/state to `physics-engine` bodies and consume deterministic results back into the game simulation. React must never become the collision authority.

## ECS boundary

`ecs-lab` is evidence and experimentation, not the application runtime. If Zoo reaches a scale where an ECS materially improves simulation organization or performance, the reusable ECS contract should first be extracted into an explicit shared crate/repository, then adopted by Zoo. Copying a lab implementation directly into `zoo-core` would recreate the same ownership problem this architecture is intended to prevent.
